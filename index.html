            <p>Hi Katrina,</p>
            
            <p>
                I know we’re not together anymore, because no matter how things have changed between us, today I couldn’t ignore. It reminded me of us. the comfort, the love we once shared. And even though it’s not my place to say this anymore, you were the first person that came to mind today.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I don’t even know if you’ll read this, or if you’ll care to. Maybe you’ve already moved on. Maybe you’re healing, living, growing just as I’ve been trying to do too. But tonight, I felt the weight of missing you a little more heavily than usual. It’s like these special days come with a whisper from the past, moments that used to mean so much. And though there’s no us now, those memories still matter to me and you.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I’m not writing this hoping to change anything. I’m not trying to reopen wounds or ask for something that no longer belongs to me. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I miss you so much and I love you. Not out of loneliness or regret, but from a place of quiet love that still In me, even in your absence. I miss the way you made everything a little lighter. I miss the way we used to talk about anything and everything, how you always seemed to know when something was wrong, even when I said I was fine. I miss being able to share things with you first, whether it was exciting or scary or small.
            </p>

            <p>
                You were a beautiful chapter in my life, one that helped me grow, one that taught me about love, one that I’ll always be grateful for. I hope you’re happy. 
            </p>

            <p>
                So, happy Girlfriend Day. Even if you’re not mine anymore, you’ll always be someone incredibly special to me. I carry your memory with me, not with bitterness, but with gratitude.
            </p>

            <p>
                Take care of yourself always.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With all my heart,<br>
